A workshop for young students about basics in programming via live action coding

## Target
The workshop targets students from 1st to 8th grade.

**Background**
No background in programming required. The workshop is actually designed for students with zero knowledge on programming and development.

## Objectives
The purpose of this workshop is to let students understand how computers and programs work. The following key questions are answered:

- What is a program?
- How does a developer make a program?
- How does a computer run a program?

## Introduction
The experience is designed to let students experience the core activities in a computer microprocessor (CPU) by having them emulate a processing unit at work and running a program which moves a character on a chessboard through very simple instructions (`turn left`, `turn right`, etc.).
